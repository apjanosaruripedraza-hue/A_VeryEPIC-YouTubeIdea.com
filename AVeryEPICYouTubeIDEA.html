<p class="sukuna"> Our Youtube Channel will be known for it's home cooking. We create videos that show how to prepare simple, delicious meals in a way that feels approachable and fun. The goal is to inspire viewers to cook at home, learn new techniques, and enjoy the process of making food. It will have a original appraoch of using GACHA LIFE characters to represent the chefs, recorders, and VA's to make it extra fun and original. <br>Our Videos will fall under entertainment and education, we'll entertain our viewers by having short stories, fun games, and a bit of trend settings. While doing so, we'll also talk about Sitio Bebe in a way that isn't too over bearing or too much to the fact that it's not even a cooking show anymore. It will have it's own section, of course! </p>

<h1 style="padding-top:30px; padding-left:30px; color:  white;font-family: Times New Roman;"> WHAT WE NEED TO BE A CHANNEL</h1>
<p class="sukuna"> To start our cooking channel, we need a few essentials to make everything run smoothly. A <strong>budget</strong> is important because we’ll need money for ingredients like rice, meat, vegetables, and fruits. The <strong>right materials</strong> such as cookware, utensils, and storage containers are necessary for preparing, cooking, and keeping food fresh.  <br><br><strong>Kitchen essentials</strong> like a stove, cleaning tools, and safety items helps us cook safely and keep our space clean.  <br><br>Finally, basic <strong>skills</strong> in cooking methods, portioning, and ingredient substitutions are needed so we can prepare meals confidently and adjust when something is missing. These basics make sure our cooking channel is practical, safe, and enjoyable to watch, including a few <button onclick=showTIPS()>tips</button>
